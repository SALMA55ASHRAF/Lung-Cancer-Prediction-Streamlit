# Lung Cancer Prediction using Streamlit

This project is a Streamlit web application for predicting the risk level of lung cancer based on user input. It uses a trained Keras model and a scaler for preprocessing.

## Features
- Collects user input through a sidebar.
- Predicts the risk level (Low, Medium, High) using a trained machine learning model.
- Displays the prediction result on the main page.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python packages:
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
